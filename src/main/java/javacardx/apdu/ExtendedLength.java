 * The <code>ExtendedLength</code> interface serves as a tagging interface to indicate that the applet

 * the applet may receive and send up to 32767 bytes of APDU data.
 * 
 * <p>The APDU command header in the APDU buffer will use the variable length header defined
 * in ISO7816-4 with a 3 byte Lc value when the Lc field in the incoming APDU header is 3 bytes
 * long. The incoming data in that case will begin at APDU buffer offset 7.</p>

Secure Element Emulator
===

This project aims at emulating a secure element environment for debugging and rapid-prototyping of secure element applets. It is a fork of the open-source Java Card simulator [jCardSim](http://jcardsim.org/) (original source code available [here](https://github.com/licel/jcardsim)). Within our research we added extensions to emulate an application life-cycle that matches the life-cycle of applications on real smartcard chips.

The idea and concepts of the emulation environment are explained in
